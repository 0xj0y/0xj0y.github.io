### How a perfect trap day forms:
Days like this is easy for people who trades in 5 min or larger tf. but as a scalper, it can be challenging. as in larger tf, it does seem negligible move but some moves in 2 min tf is so large that it triggers sls. And this also happens multiple times so people get frustrated and leaves and then real moves happen. But if someone was trading in 5 min tf then it was easy for them.
