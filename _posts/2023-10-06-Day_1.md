### Overall nifty movement

Nifty opened around 100 point gap up and stayed above R3 Fiv pivot and 20 EMA whole day. Though intraday move from opening is only about 70 indicating not so bullish market.

### Intraday trades:
* Trade 1 (5TF):
![5TF_long](/images/06-11-2023/5TF_long.png)
    1. As market was opened about 100 point gap up, it was risky to enter in any kind of trade at opening. It is better to wait for at least 15 five minute candles or 75 minutes to find direction.
    2. 2nd candle after opening broke opening candle high and closed above opening candle high. It was an indication of bullish price movement but it was not enough to enter a trade as it could have been a trap for retail call buyers. Because nothing happens without trapping retailers.
    3. At this point entering into a long position can be rewarding but also risky due to rapid premium decay if price decides to come down. On the other hand shorting put is also risky as puts can spike due to sharp down move. So better is to do wait and watch until price creates clear HH-HL formation.
    4. Price gave minor pullback after this decaying enough for all call buyers and gave a push to break above day high at 10:15 am.
    5. At this point market is bullish but entry should be at a demand zone only.
    6. the low at 9:50 am created internal liquidity at 19324 for large quantity put sellers and future and call buyers. Also it was acting as stop loss for call buyers who entered after day high broke. If price has to go up, it has to tap all the liquidity below this level.
    7. At 11:05 am, a long legged hammer was formed which indicates massive liquidity sweep. It was entry signal. Target should have been initially day high and after keep trailing, exit should be at further high where market closed.
