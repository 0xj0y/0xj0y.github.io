### Overall nifty movement

![Overall trend](/images/06-11-2023/overall.png)

Nifty opened around 100 point gap up and stayed above R3 Fiv pivot and 20 EMA whole day. Though intraday move from opening is only about 70 indicating not so bullish market.

### Intraday trades:
* Trade 1 (5TF):
![5TF_long](/images/06-11-2023/5TF_long.png)
    1. As market was opened about 100 point gap up, it was risky to enter in any kind of trade at opening. It is better to wait for at least 15 five minute candles or 75 minutes to find direction.
    2. 2nd candle after opening broke opening candle high and closed above opening candle high. It was an indication of bullish price movement but it was not enough to enter a trade as it could have been a trap for retail call buyers. Because nothing happens without trapping retailers.
    3. At this point entering into a long position can be rewarding but also risky due to rapid premium decay if price decides to come down. On the other hand shorting put is also risky as puts can spike due to sharp down move. So better is to do wait and watch until price creates clear HH-HL formation.
    4. Price gave minor pullback after this decaying enough for all call buyers and gave a push to break above day high at 10:15 am.
    5. At this point market is bullish but entry should be at a demand zone only.
    6. the low at 9:50 am created internal liquidity at 19324 for large quantity put sellers and future and call buyers. Also it was acting as stop loss for call buyers who entered after day high broke. If price has to go up, it has to tap all the liquidity below this level.

    7. At 11:05 am, a long legged hammer was formed which indicates massive liquidity sweep. It was entry signal. Target should have been initially day high and after keep trailing, exit should be at further high where market closed.

* Trade 2(2TF):
![2TF_long_scalp](/images/06-11-2023/2TF_long_scalp.png)
    1. Nifty broke its opening 2TF candle high and came down very slowly.
    2. Ideal thing is to wait until price goes below 61.8% of initial move. It ensures a good risk to reward also more demand. 
    3. After price goes below 61.8 fib level, price goes up indicating a entry for short and quick scalp trade. Target should be day high. here price broke day high with a solid candle and exit should be close of the candle
* Trade 3(2TF):
![2TF_short_scalp](/images/06-11-2023/2TF_short_scalp.png)
    1. Price broke day high and immediately came down. This indicates a possible liquidity grab. This could lead to bigger fall if price broke day low as there was 116 point gap below it.
    2. Broke below 2TF swing low indicating a change in market structure.
    3. A small supply zone was created in this process which was a good entry point with 1:5 risk to reward. 
    4. Exit should be ideally at day low but even after strong impulsive move, last candle retracted around 50% during closing indicating buying at lower levels. SO exit is at the close of 3rd candle.

* Trade 3(2TF):
![2TF_long_scalp_2](/images/06-11-2023/2TF_long_scalp_2.png)
    1. Price broke above day high and sustained above day high.
    2. Slowly came below the resistance line and immediately created a bullish candle. This is a good entry for short and quick scalp.
    3. As it is almost 3 pm, target should be 2times the risk as move will be short but quick creating spike in premium. 

* Rest of the day:

## KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. If market opens at a big gap up or gap down, wait for at least 15 or more 5 minute candles or more than 75 minutes to find out what actually is going on.
2. trade should be taken after a retracing more than 61.8% for initial move. The last candle low should touch the 0.618 fib level.
3. A long legged doji or hammer formed a key level indicates a liquidity grab.
4. Scalping should always be at supply or demand zones or liquidity levels. In between these levels all moves are trapping moves.
